  <br>
  <br>
<p>In this file I have added 3 projects.</p>
<br>
<h3>Quiz App</h3> - <p>In this application I have used dummy data to validate the answers for the given questions. I have devided Question and Answer logic into different components.</p>
<br>
<p>Script - 1. npm install, 2.npm run dev</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Placepicker</h3> - <p>In this project I have used dummy backend for fetching the places images and names of the places. I have also used the latitude and longitude functionality of browser to get the users location and according to that app shows nearest scenery image.</p> 
<br>
<p>Script - Step 1 ->  1. cd .\backend\   2. node .\app.js <br></p>
                        <p>- Step 2 -> 1. npm install   2. npm run dev</p>
<br>
<br>
                        
<h3>Form App</h3> - <p>As the name seems the Form app will be simple but in this Form App I have used some advance comcepts like Formdata and Form action. In this project I have learned new ways of creating forms and validating the forms in new React way.</p>
<br>
<p>Script - 1. npm install 2. npm run dev</p>
